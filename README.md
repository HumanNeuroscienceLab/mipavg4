MRJ: For the moment, adding this file simply to verify that my GitHub access is working correctly.

But every project should have a README, right?

Perhaps in the future, this document will have more useful contents such as a version history, usage notes, other documentation, or 
 other info?

To start off, maybe I'll list MRJ's aims for commits in the near future:
* Fix bug (?) where including/excluding certain stimulus codes in SGC files can yield incorrect #s of occurrences for OTHER stimulus 
  codes (which in theory should have nothing to do with the codes included/excluded).
* Add in ability to linearly detrend epochs (which can be approximated right now with the right high-pass filter, I guess, but that 
  isn't quite the same...)
* Add in ability to regress out HEOG/VEOG (or potentially an arbitrary set of other channels) from all other channels' data to 
  remove any residual influence from small eye movements.
